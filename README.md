# Next.js 15 - next/link Unexpected Behavior

This repository demonstrates a potential issue in Next.js 15 when using the `next/link` component to navigate to pages that might not exist during Static Site Generation (SSG) or Server-Side Rendering (SSR).

## Problem
The `bug.js` file contains a simple component that uses `next/link` to create links to `/` (home) and `/about` pages. If the `/about` page (for example) is not defined or conditionally generated, Next.js might throw an error or produce unexpected behavior during build or runtime.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file offers a solution to this issue.  It provides conditional rendering or error handling mechanisms to mitigate issues related to missing page links.  More details about the solution are included in the file's comments.
