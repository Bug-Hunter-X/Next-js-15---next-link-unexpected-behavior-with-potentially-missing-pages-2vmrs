```javascript
import Link from 'next/link';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Link href="/">
        <a>Home</a>
      </Link>
      <Link href="/about">
        <a>About</a>
      </Link>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```
This code uses the `next/link` component to create links.  However, if the pages linked to (`/` and `/about`) are not defined, Next.js might throw an error or generate unexpected behavior during static site generation or server-side rendering.  This can be especially problematic when dealing with dynamic routes or when these pages are conditionally generated or deleted.
